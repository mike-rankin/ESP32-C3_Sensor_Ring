# ESP32-C3_Sensor_Ring
Unfortunately this Arduino based ESP32 Sensor Ring is not an open source project but the customer did give permissions to post images and adescription of the hardware.
The specs are:
-ESP32-C3 Processor
-0.49" 64x32 i2c Oled display
-LIS2DH12TR accelerometer
-3.3V & 1.8V LDO in tiny UDFN-4 footprints
-MCP73831T-2ACI/OT LiPo charger
-SGP30 eCO2/TVOC sensor
-SGP40 Air quality sensor
-SHT20 Temperature/Humidity sensor

The original ring is an XXXX that has limited features without any sensors. I remove the cap, desolder the circuit board, pushbutton switch and display from the existing board to install the ESP32 sensor board.
